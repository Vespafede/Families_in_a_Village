# Families_in_a_Village

What does this program do?
We are in a village of n families (a man and a woman). All families have children until a boy comes out and then they stop. What will be the male/female ratio when all families have finished having children? Incredible but true, the closer the number of families gets to infinity the more the value of the ratio is closer to 1.

Instructions for running the program:
1. Download python from the following link: https://www.python.org/downloads/ (if you have a different OS from Windows, choose the version for your OS)
2. Run the python installer (be sure to install pip as well)
3. In your command prompt run "pip install matplotlib"
4. Download on your pc this repository and save it where you prefer
5. Edit the file "families.py" to insert the number of families desiderated
6. Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file "families.py"
7. Run the program by typing "python families.py"
8. Enjoy the result!
